# Post-Push Verification Checklist

## After Pushing to GitHub

### 1. Verify Repository Structure ✅

Go to: https://github.com/cderamos-2ct/n8n-nodes-custom

Check that you see:
- [ ] README.md displays on the main page with proper formatting
- [ ] All TypeScript files are present (*.node.ts, *.credentials.ts)
- [ ] All SVG icon files are present (mightycall.svg, onprintshop.svg, xpsshipper.svg)
- [ ] Documentation files are visible (LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
- [ ] package.json is present and shows correct metadata
- [ ] .gitignore is present

### 2. Verify Files Are Properly Ignored ✅

Confirm these are **NOT** in the repository:
- [ ] node_modules/ directory is NOT visible
- [ ] dist/ directory is NOT visible
- [ ] *.tgz package file is NOT in the repo (it's for local use only)

### 3. Test Installation from GitHub ✅

On your local machine, test that others can install it:

```bash
# Create a test directory
mkdir C:\temp\n8n-test
cd C:\temp\n8n-test

# Try installing from GitHub
npm install github:cderamos-2ct/n8n-nodes-custom

# Verify it installed
ls node_modules/@cderamos-2ct/n8n-nodes-custom
```

```

## Success Criteria ✅

Your package is ready when:
- ✅ Code is pushed to GitHub
- ✅ README displays correctly
- ✅ Release v1.0.0 is created with .tgz attached
- ✅ Installation from GitHub works
- ✅ Icons display correctly in n8n
- ✅ All three nodes function properly
- ✅ Documentation is complete

## Common Issues & Solutions 🔧

### Issue: Large files rejected by GitHub
**Solution**: Ensure .gitignore is working. node_modules should never be pushed.

### Issue: Authentication failed during push
**Solution**: Use Personal Access Token, not password. Get one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### Issue: Icons still showing as question marks
**Solution**: Verify the .svg files are in the repository and the credential files have `icon = 'file:xxx.svg';` property.

### Issue: Package installation fails
**Solution**: Check package.json has correct "files" array and "main" entry point.

## Next Steps 🎯

After everything is verified:

1. **Monitor Issues**: Watch for user feedback on GitHub
2. **Plan Updates**: Keep a list of feature requests
3. **Maintenance**: Update dependencies periodically
4. **Documentation**: Add more examples based on user questions
5. **Community**: Engage with users who star or use your nodes
